# The GrapeVine

### T3A2-A, Full Stack App (Part A)

#### A Team Project By: Jacqueline Cope & Nga Dang

---

### Purpose

Following a few glasses of wine and plenty of conversation with our client, _Vineyard Productions_, we have been requested to create a full stack web application to support the wine lovers of Australia and Australian wine industry.

The purpose of the site is to bring people together on a dedicated platform where they can share their love of Australian wine and learn a tip or two along the way. This benefits the community of wine consumers at all levels to then be able to try recommended wines by those who have shared and contributed within the community.

In addition to sharing wine experiences, a dashboard of the most popular wines that users have _liked_ or _recommended_ will be available.

### Functionality / Features

- Age verification to ensure users are of legal age
- Each week the website administrator will share a number of new wines, as posts, for users to share their opinions about
- To participate in the community users must create an account, however non-users (guests) will have viewing access only and limited access to features
- A registered and signed in user that is authenticated:
  - Has the ability to like a wine that has been posted, which will increase the popularity of the wine and may be displayed in the dashboard
  - Can comment on wine posts
  - Can delete or edit their own post
  - Cannot adjust or delete another person's comments
  - Has the ability to browse the catalogue of other contributors (other posts) and add comments accordingly
- A guest may access and read all comments and see ratings without contributing. Contributing means making comments or participating in rating the wines
- A Navbar to store all main links for easy navigation of the site, including login/sign-up
- The site runs on the basis of trust, where the user may _like_ a wine post by 'cheersing' (ðŸ¥‚) to like a post, following a similar concept to Facebook/Twitter. A user who has tried the wine and would like to recommend it to others can do so by _â€˜recommendingâ€™_ (ðŸŽ–) the wine.
- The website will include filtering options to assist in the user search experience ie. wine type, grape, etc
- The site will include wine ratings to show the most popular wines rated by users
- The site will include 2 types of user accounts, including a website administrator as well as a standard user accounts. All users will login via the same login access
- A website administrator will have the ability to delete inappropriate content of any user

### Target Audience

- The target audience will need to be at the right legal age for drinking. The user must be 18+
- The App is targeted for users living in Australia at varying legal age groups specifically interested in Australian wines

### Trello Board

#### Trello board explanation and workflow

In our kick-off meeting, we chose to use the Trello board to help us manage our project. With Trello, we are able to use the Kanban method to help us work in an agile workflow. Allowing for easy changes to be integrated into our workflow. These changes may come from our developer team or directly from out client.

You will see in the screenshots below that we work off from the five typical columns: Backlog, To do, Doing, Testing & Done.

Starting from the left of the board, we will have activities that require action and upon agreement and prior discussion, we would then have team members allocated to each cards.
Upon completion of each card, the second team member would review the work to ensure we have quality checking.

We have come across some tasks that require to be brought back from the â€˜doneâ€™ column as it requires further modification after a review. This usually calls for a team meeting and sometimes original ideas will require rethinking and changes need to be made.

You can see this happened in the screenshots below for the User Stories and Architecture Diagram cards.

Each task/cards will have a â€˜due dateâ€™ nominated to ensure we have some idea of priority in our work timeframe of when they should be completed. Anything that is overdue will change its colour from green to red to alert us.

As a member of the Trello, I can see where and what my team member have changed on the cards as it displays a red bell notification on my version of trello. You can see this below on Trello dated 03_07_22.
